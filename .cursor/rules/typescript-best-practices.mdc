- Enable strict mode in your `tsconfig.json` for better type checking
- Use type inference where possible to reduce unnecessary type annotations
- Prefer union types over enums for better flexibility
- Utilize generics for reusable components and functions
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Leverage TypeScript's utility types for common transformations

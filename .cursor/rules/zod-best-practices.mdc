- Define schemas for all incoming data and API responses
- Use Zod's type inference to generate TypeScript types automatically
- Implement custom error messages for better user feedback
- Utilize Zod's built-in validation methods for complex data structures

- Implement proper error handling for validation failures
- Use schema refinements for complex validation rules
- Keep schemas organized and maintainable

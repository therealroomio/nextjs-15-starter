- Keep stores focused on specific domains or features
- Use middleware like `persist` for local storage integration
- Implement proper type safety using TypeScript
- Avoid overusing global state; prefer component-level state when possible
- Use selectors for optimal performance
- Implement proper error handling in store actions
- Keep store actions pure and predictable
- Use devtools middleware during development
